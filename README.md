# ArtifactsPromoter

This gradle plugin collects artifacts from one repo and promote them to a new repo as a bundled up zip.

## How



1. Add the gradle plugin to your build.gradle:
```
    plugins {
        id "net.praqma.promote" version "1.0.0"
    }
```

2. Add upload folder to build.gradle
```
buildproperties.publishing {
    zip {
        from ('build/resolvedDep/')
    }
}
```
3. Update promote.properties
```
    productName=ReleasePackage
    version=1.0.1  
    group=net.praqma
    resolveRepo=libs-release-local
    destinationRepo=promote-release-local
    artifacts=artifacts.txt
```
4. Add your artifacts to a file divided by new line, containing group:name:version
```
    com.gradle:plugin:1.2.3
    net.default.customLib:1.0.0
```
5. Update gradle.properties in your ~/.gradle folder 
```
repositoryManagerUsername=username
repositoryManagerPassword=password

```

6. Promote your artifacts with
